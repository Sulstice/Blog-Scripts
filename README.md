A little repository for my blog posts which has a collection of odd scripts here and there that I found useful. Hopefully, it is to y'all as well. 

Environment
===========

Generally, I like to code in python (it's how I grew up and started) but I have a fondness for web programming, front-end technologies, colour theory, and starting to get better at postgresSQL. 

Genesis
=======

Began when I was inspired about other blog posts.
